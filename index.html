   <p style = " font-family: 'Architects Daughter', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, serif;;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">In 2020, with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the problem of misinformation became 
   pervasive, particularly on social media. This text and social media analytics project focused on sources of misinformation found on popular alternative health websites. Using packages in RStudio (rselenium
   and rvest) the 2020 corpus of health related articles were scraped from three websites. A command line linux program called Massmine was used to access the Twitter API for relevant
   tweets made by website stakeholders. Facebook posts were collected from CrowdTangle and website traffic data was obtained from Semrush. More than a dozen collections of data
   containing several thousand observations were analyzed. Various tidyverse packages in R were utilized for cleaning text along with lubridate for parsing dates, snowballC for word stemming and other R packages for text cleaning such as stringr, UTF8, and textclean.
   Text mining was performed using the tm and quanteda packages and syuzhet was used for sentiment analysis. Plotting was performed with various R packages including ggplot, igraph,
   plotly, and wordcloud.
